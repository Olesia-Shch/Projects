1. Create GitHub repo with:
 - test python backend server. Just script which listening on some port and respond 200 on /
 - Dockerfile with everything needed to run this script
 - GitHub action which will build docker image automatically and push to docker hub. Use Github secrets to store your docker hub creds
2. Write terraform code to create EKS cluster
 - one node group with one node
 - nginx ingress controller
3. Write terraform code which will install ArgoCD to EKS using helm chart or raw k8s manifest
 - argocd must have dns name in domain: watashinoheyadesu.pp.ua
4. Write K8S manifests to deploy your app from item 1 to EKS.
 - deployment, service, ingress.
 - app must be available by dns name in domain: watashinoheyadesu.pp.ua
5. Write ArgoCD app which will deliver code from item 4 to EKS and will update it when new image appeared in docker hub
