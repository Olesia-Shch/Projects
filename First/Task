Use Vagrant to raise 2 virtual machines: VM1 and VM2
In the same Vagrant, add the installation: MysqlServer, Prometheus mysql exporter, Prometheus node exporter on VM1. Install Grafana, Prometheus, Prometheus Alert manager on VM2
Then manually configure the Prometheus mysql exporter to fetch data from the Mysql server. Add a bash script to the Vagrant configuration that would create a database in Mysql (Shop database).
Configure Prometheus to collect metrics from Node exporter and Prometheus Mysql exporter. Ensure that the metrics appear on the Prometheus web interface
Configure Prometheus alert manager and Prometheus to send an email to your inbox when the CPU usage on VM1 is more than 10%.
Connect Grafana to Prometheus and add a dashboard to display a metric with CPU usage and any metrics from the Mysql server
